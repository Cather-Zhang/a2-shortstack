## What's your favorite fruit?
This application asks the users for their name, age, sex, daily calories and favorite fruit. Since fruits are high in fiber, the application also provides recommended amount of fiber to consume daily based on users' daily calorie consumption. The CSS positioning technique I used in this application is flex, along with the positioning functions like align-items, justify-content.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The application is on single paged html. There are two bottons "See survey result" and "add your response" which directs to the survey result table and add response block, respectively. When the user submits a response, the server updates the result table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 

Evalution 1: By Patrick O'Mullan
    Patrick did not have problems with my design. According to him, the application was straightforward and self-explanatory. He mentioned that any user have the link to the website will be able to delete any responses, which is not very secure. And this is a feature I would need to think about when I learn more about web development should definitely be considered in the future. 

Evalution 2: By Nikki Lam
    Nikki had one comment about the order of my two buttons. They were originally positioned as - "see survey result" on the left and "add your response" on the right. But she said it would make more sense to have the order swapped because "add response" section was before the result table. And people tend to read left to right. I have changed the order of the buttons based on her feedback and I 100% agree with that. She said the application was easy to use.
